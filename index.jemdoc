== Short Bio 
Jiaming is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at Georagia Tech, under the supervision of [https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~monteiro/ Prof. Renato D. C. Monteiro]. He holds a master's degree in computational science and engineering. As an undergrad, he studied ocean engineering and applied math in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where he worked on applications of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_analysis_method homotopy analysis method] with [http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=20&info_id=93&flag=2 Prof. Zhiliang Lin].
== Research Interests 
His primary research goal is to design, analyze and implement fast algorithms for solving a general class of optimization problems. His research interests broadly include topics in optimization and algorithms, such as
